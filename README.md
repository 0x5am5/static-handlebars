# Static Handlebars Template

This repository serves as a clonable repo to help kick off a basic handlebars project. It promotes several ideologies worth noting. Your workable files exist in the app/ folder and will be exported into the Distribution (dist/) folder. The project will livereload after every change.

## Grunt

The project runs of the Grunt task-runner and packages include...

- Assemble
- Grunt Contrib Sass
- PostCSS
- Webpack
- Grunt Contrib Watch

The template generates its own static webserver using **grunt-contrib-connect**.

## ES2015

Weback contains the **babel-loader** plugin using the **ES2015** preset promoting pure JavaScript written in ES2015.

### JavaScript Documentation

Documenting your JavaScript is encouraged and will generate your docs using **yuidoc** in a 'Docs' folder at the root of this project.

## ITCSS

The project encourages the **ITCSS** architecture created by CSSWizardry. Folders are in place so you can begin using this immediately using **SASS** to bring it altogether.
